Yocto kirkstone compatible meeta layer for zynq7000. 

video-platform-base-dev is a development image, not production image.
It's based on mainline Linux, not Xilinx ones.

It supports qt5 (meta-qt5 has to be added to local config before compiling)

The image contains my linux framebuffer driver basen on simplefb and xilinx dma framebuffer (the one provided by Xilinx 
is just a DMA device, it does not create /dev/fb)

fbdev is creater in order to make it possible run qt5 (qtquick also) applications using linuxfb, without X11 nor wayland, nor any other windowing system.

Linux uboot has to be compiled separately - it's not integrated here yet.

After exporting a platform from vivado desing suite and device tree creation, its directory should be set in local conf as ZYNQ_DTS_DIR
